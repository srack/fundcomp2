When the user runs piestimate, he or she is requested to enter the desired number of
digits for the pi estimate (given by the series pi = 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 -4/7 + 4/9 - ...).
If the user enters a number less than 2, an error message is received, and he or she 
is again requested to enter a number.  When a number greater than or equal to 2 is 
entered, the program displays the pi estimate after each term is added, starting with
1 term and continuing up to the number the user entered (ie.  If the user entered 3, 
the program dislays the estimates after 1 term is added, 2 terms are added, and 3 
terms are added).

The program piestimate.cpp is defined entirely in the main function.  The program 
requests information from the user using cout and receives it with cin.  The program
then implements a while loop to ensure that the user has entered a valid number (>=2).
If it is invalid input, the pogram display an error message and asks again for the
number of terms using cout.  Once valid input is entered, the while loop is exited 
and the program implements a for loop that recalculates the input adding each term
and displays this sum to the screen for each term until the requested number of 
terms has been displayed.

This program was verified to be correct by checking different terms and comparing the
program's output with a sum of the terms of the series computed on a calculator.  
Invalid input was also checked, and the program correctly displayed an error message
and requested new input.
